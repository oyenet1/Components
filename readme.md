## 1. Ziglar on Selling by *`Zig Ziglar`*

- You were born to win. But to win please remember that “The Will to Win Is Nothing Without the Will to Prepare.  **Zig Ziglar**
  
- Selling is more than a
profession; it is a way of life.   **Zig Ziglar**

- Please remember as you start your journey that a `“green”` salesman will sell more than a `“blue”` one.  **Zig Ziglar**
- Every person in every profession (lawyer, doctor, accountant, engineer, teacher, bus or cab driver, shipping clerk, counselor, receptionist, corporate executive, entertainer, administrator, coach, cook, etc.) is a salesperson.  **Zig Ziglar**
- One of the basic truisms of selling is that `“slumps”` will occur. **Zig Ziglar**
- You’ve got to be before you can do and do
before you can have! **Zig Ziglar**
- Laughing more often and feeling better about myself would have prevented many of the bruises to my fragile ego during those difficult days early in my career when I was trying so desperately hard to survive. **Zig Ziglar**
- Regardless of who we are or what we do, everyone needs what psychologists call “accomplishment feedback”
- You cannot get out of
something you have never been in.
- The best-paying hard work in the world is selling, and the poorest- paying easy work in the world is selling!
- You are in business, “for yourself but not by yourself.”
- The profession of selling soon teaches you that people do things for their reasons, not yours.
- As salespeople, we encounter people at every emotional level—when they’re happy, excited, and enthusiastic; and when they’re irritated and down in the dumps. We learn how to deal with the extroverts, the introverts, the procrastinators, the optimists, the pessimists, the detail- oriented, the impetuous, the loudmouths, the big shots, the egomaniacs, and a host of others.
- Successful salespersons are also excellent managers. They have to manage time, territory, personal habits, and life in general. The better they manage their lives, the better they will be able to manage their business
- Successful sales professionals learn to keep a balance. This area is where many people drop the ball because they think balance means giving equal priority and the same amount of time to everything.
- You must separate priorities and balance—“priorities” relate to chronological order; “balance” relates to variety.
- *The key is in understanding that when all is said and done, you must be able to answer the following question: `Are you happy, healthy, and
reasonably prosperous and secure, and do you have friends, peace of mind, and good family relationships?` As you examine each of these areas, let me challenge you to look at your activities and daily tasks. Do the results of the tasks you are working on yield the results you are looking for? If not, why not? If not, what are you going to do about it? These are the questions individuals who would have their names on the doors of the executive suites of tomorrow must answer.*

## 2. Sell with a story by *`Paul Smith`*
_`But, as you can see in the picture, there’s not much more than cactus on the island for them to eat. And pigs don’t much like cactus. I guess in typical laid-back Bahamian fashion, the entrepreneur failed to plan that far ahead. So the pigs weren’t doing very well. But at some point, a restaurant owner on a nearby island started bringing his kitchen refuse by boat over to Big Major Cay and dumping it a few dozen yards off shore. The hungry pigs eventually learned to swim to get to the food. Each generation of pigs followed suit, and now all the pigs on the island can swim.`_

- Stories sell. And the people who can tell a good sales story sell more than
people who can’t.
- Many people assume that a talent for storytelling is the kind of thing you’re either born with or you’ll never have. And while it’s true that some people are born with a natural ability to tell stories, it’s not true that you can’t learn it.

- What is a sales story, why should you tell them, which sales stories should you tell and when should you tell them, how can you come up with these stories, and how can you craft and deliver them for maximum impact.

## Features of story-telling
1. **Time**
2. **Place**
3. **A main Character**
4. **An obstacle**
5. **A Goal**
6. **Events**

## WHY TELL SALES STORIES?
1. STORIES HELP THE BUYER RELAX AND JUST LISTEN
2. STORIES HELP BUILD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS
  - A story is the shortest distance between being a **`stranger`** and a **`friend`**.
  - Sory-Telling is like extending your hand for a handshake
3. STORYTELLING SPEAKS TO THE PART OF THE BRAIN WHERE DECISIONS ARE ACTUALLY MADE
  - So if you’re trying to influence buyers’ decisions, using facts and rational arguments alone isn’t enough. You need to influence them emotionally, and stories are your best vehicle to do that.
  - The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor. - **_Psychologist Jonathan Haidt_**
4. STORIES MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE BUYER TO REMEMBER YOU, YOUR IDEAS, AND YOUR PRODUCT
  - `Two legs` sit on `three legs`, eating `one leg`. Then along comes `four legs` and steals `one leg` from `two legs`. `Two legs` then hits `four legs` with `three legs` and gets his `one leg` back. `A young boy` ___(two legs)___ sits on a `stool` ___(three legs)___, eating a `chicken bone` ___(one leg)___. Then along comes a `dog` ___(four legs)___ that steals the `chicken bone` ___(one leg)___ from the `boy` ___(two legs)___. The `boy` ___(two legs)___ then hits the `dog` ___(four legs)___ with the `stool` ___(three legs)___ and gets his `chicken bone` ___(one leg)___ back.
5. STORYTELLING ACTUALLY INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT YOU’RE SELLING
  - _`They then asked volunteers to write short, fictional stories about each item. For example, to accompany a ceramic piggy bank, one author wrote a story from the perspective of a little girl who thought the piggy bank was cursed. Her father would come home each payday and put half his pay in the piggy bank, only to watch during the week as the paper money in the pig turned into coins and then eventually disappeared.
Walker and Glenn then placed each item for sale on eBay. But instead of putting a simple description next to the picture of each item, they put only the fictional story that had been written for it. Care was taken to make sure it was clear that the story was purely fictional so as not to suggest that the object being sold was somehow more special than the common household item it appeared to be.
Within five months, all 100 items had been sold. The experimenters originally paid a total of $128.74 for the items, but the resale price paid on eBay totaled $3,612.51, or a 2,800 percent increase in value. In the words of Walker and Glenn, their experiment showed that “Narrative transforms insignificant objects into significant ones.” In other words, stories turned cheap objects into valuable ones.`_

6. STORYTELLING HIGHLIGHTS YOUR MAIN IDEA BY
MOVING IT TO ANOTHER CONTEXT
     - People want things to be right and when they’re not, they obsess with what’s
“wrong”
7. STORIES ARE CONTAGIOUS
8. STORYTELLING GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE
ORIGINAL
9. YOUR BUYERS WANT MORE STORIES FROM YOU
   1.  Why and how your company was founded,
   2.  who you are and what your values are,
   3.  how and why the product you’re selling was invented,
   4.   stories about how the product is made, and
   5.   the level of integrity they can expect from you and your company.
   
10. STORYTELLING IS MORE FUN THAN DELIVERING A
CANNED SALES PITCH, FOR YOU AND THE BUYER

### WHAT SALES STORIES YOU NEED AND WHEN TO TELL THEM

#### when to tell a story. The moment you introduce yourself is when you tell a story.
 *`THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY you have to tell a story is the moment you introduce
yourself to a potential new customer. It could be in an email you’re sending or a
phone call you’re placing for the purpose of introducing yourself. Or it could be
face to face at a networking event as you’re exchanging business cards with
someone who may or may not turn out to be a prospect. Whatever the venue, the
question you’re answering is likely the same: “So, what do you do for a living?”THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY you have to tell a story is the moment you introduce

someone who may or may not turn out to be a prospect. Whatever the venue, the
question you’re answering is likely the same: “So, what do you do for a living?”`*

### EXPLAINING WHAT YOU DO SIMPLY
***`hors d’oeuvre table`***
Introduction sample 
*“I represent a
company that’s best in class at optimizing the distribution channels between the
core manufacturing center and the desired consumer experience.”*

- So basically what I do is to look at all the steps in the process and try
to figure out if there is some way we can do them faster, better, less expensively, or more
efficiently.
1So basically what I do is to look at all the steps in the process and try
to figure out if there is some way we can do them faster, better, less expensively, or more
efficiently.
- Just rely on your knowledge
of the business and the typical type of problems your company tends to solve,
and create a plausible storyline around it

### EXPLAINING WHOM YOU’VE HELPED AND HOW
- Story-Telling It’s the shortest path from
*`“Hello, nice to meet you”`* to *`“When’s a good day for me to stop by your office?”`*

## Exercise
A. Invent a “What I do, simply” story
  - Choose a fictional main character in a typical industry you
serve.
  - List a plausible series of events that leads to the problem your
product or service is designed to fix
  - Briefly describe what that problem looks like to the customer
  - Write one sentence to describe what you or your company
does to help fix that problem

B. Develop a “Whom I’ve helped and how” story.
  - Choose an actual client in a typical industry you serve. (You
don’t need to reveal the client’s name.)
  - Sketch out a brief outline of the events that led up to the
client’s needing your product or service—in other words, the
background and the problem or opportunity the client
encountered. (Include just the basic facts for now.
  - List the main steps of what you or your product did for the
client
  - Explain the outcome in terms of how it benefited the customer
(e.g., “And that’s when the procurement director really got a
seat at the decision-making table”).

### STORIES FOR MOTIVATION
### FINDING YOUR PERSONAL MOTIVATION STORY
 - _`“Sales isn’t something you do to someone. It’s something you do for someone.” In other words, if you do your job properly, you’re doing people a great service"` **zig Ziglar**_

### STORIES TO RELAX AND TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF THE CALL
  - _Over the years I’ve learned to focus on all the positives and remind myself why I’m there in the first place. One of the most valuable techniques I have—it sounds a bit crazy at first, but it makes sense—is to tell myself that I am financially independent and I don’t need this deal. I’ve found that, by adopting this mindset, I relax more and care less. Instead of living with the burden of the whole company’s future, and that of its workforce, on my shoulders, I become a gentleman of means
indulging in some sport_
## EXERCISE 
  1. Find your own motivational sales story. Think about a time you went above and beyond what was expected of you and made an extraordinary difference for your client. Turn that into a story you tell yourself before every call.
  2. Think of a story that helps you relax and takes the stress out of selling. An example would be stories that help you think of yourself as the assistant buyer instead of the salesperson (as Zig Ziglar suggested). Lanigan and Goodbody’s story about a “gentleman of means” is another good example

### GETTING BUYERS TO TELL THEIR STORY
  - _YOUR FIRST OBJECTIVE in a sales call should be to get buyers to tell you their stories, not the other way around. If you don’t hear their stories first, how will you know which of your stories to tell?_
  - _“You wouldn’t trust a physician who walked into the examining room, spent an hour
telling you how great he was, and then wrote a prescription, would you?” Of course not. Then why would a buyer accept the recommendation of a salesperson who did the same thing?_

### FIVE WAYS TO GET BUYERS TO OPEN UP AND TELL YOU STORIES
- **Shut Up and Listen**
- **Ask Questions That Require a Story for an Answer**
  - **If you ask yes or no questions, you’ll get yes or no answers. Just asking questions isn’t enough. You have to ask the right kind of questions. Here are some tips.**
  - **If you want to hear a story, don’t ask someone to tell you a story. Ask her to tell you about something that happened:**
  - If you’re selling high-speed Internet service, asking “Do you like your current Internet service?” won’t get you any stories. But if you ask “Have you ever noticed that your Internet slows down after dinner?” your prospect is likely to launch into a story about the last time that happened: “Oh yeah, it does! Last Monday night I had all the guys over for the football game. In the middle of the first quarter, it started to buffer every few seconds. It got so bad, we had to go to Jim’s house to finish the game. It was embarrassing for me, and Jim’s wife wasn’t too happy with us either . . .’
  
- **Ask About Something Personal in the Buyer’s Office**
- **Get Buyers Away from the Office**
- **Tell Your Stories First**
    - If all else fails, lead by example. If you want to get buyers to tell personal stories about where they grew up, you tell a personal story about where you grew up. If you want them to tell a story about a problem they’re having with their computer, you tell a story about a problem you’re having with your computer. You know this works because it works on you. When people tell you a story, the most likely thing that’s running through your head is “Hey, something like that happened to me once,” and now you can’t wait to tell them about it. Just remember, when the buyer interrupts and starts telling you his story, refer back to tactic #1 above. Shut up and listen.
## Execise
1. **Create a list of questions to elicit the following stories from your buyers. In your next meeting, ask them for:**
   1. Personal stories to help you get to know them better
     1. Stories about the biggest problems they’re facing, so you can get a concrete idea of how you might help them
   2. Stories about how their favorite suppliers became their favorite suppliers, so you can become the next one.
2. **Draft planning notes for your next meeting to get your buyer to open up and tell you stories instead of facts. These notes should include:**
   1. Shut up and listen. Leave some silent space in the conversation with room for the buyer to fill with a story.
   2.  Require a story for an answer.
       1.  Ask open-ended questions instead of short-answer or yes/no
questions.
        2. Ask about specific events in time (What happened last year when . . . ?”).
          1. Use “problem prompts” (“Have you ever noticed that your Internet slows down after dinner?”).
Ask “day in the life” questions (“Tell me what a typical day is like for one of your team members today? A year from now?”).
3. Plan to get your buyer away from the office. Think of three specific opportunities to do that this year (for example, a market visit, a tour of retail stores or manufacturing plants, or attending a conference with you).
4. Create a list of your own stories that demonstrate the three stories you want to hear from the buyer. Your buyer will respond to hearing your story by telling a similar one of her own:
   1. Personal “get to know you” story 
   2. “Biggest problem” story
    3. “Favorite supplier (or customer)” story
