## Book 1. Ziglar on Selling by _`Zig Ziglar`_

- You were born to win. But to win please remember that “The Will to Win Is Nothing Without the Will to Prepare. **Zig Ziglar**
- Selling is more than a
  profession; it is a way of life. **Zig Ziglar**

- Please remember as you start your journey that a `“green”` salesman will sell more than a `“blue”` one. **Zig Ziglar**
- Every person in every profession (lawyer, doctor, accountant, engineer, teacher, bus or cab driver, shipping clerk, counselor, receptionist, corporate executive, entertainer, administrator, coach, cook, etc.) is a salesperson. **Zig Ziglar**
- One of the basic truisms of selling is that `“slumps”` will occur. **Zig Ziglar**
- You’ve got to be before you can do and do
  before you can have! **Zig Ziglar**
- Laughing more often and feeling better about myself would have prevented many of the bruises to my fragile ego during those difficult days early in my career when I was trying so desperately hard to survive. **Zig Ziglar**
- Regardless of who we are or what we do, everyone needs what psychologists call “accomplishment feedback”
- You cannot get out of
  something you have never been in.
- The best-paying hard work in the world is selling, and the poorest- paying easy work in the world is selling!
- You are in business, “for yourself but not by yourself.”
- The profession of selling soon teaches you that people do things for their reasons, not yours.
- As salespeople, we encounter people at every emotional level—when they’re happy, excited, and enthusiastic; and when they’re irritated and down in the dumps. We learn how to deal with the extroverts, the introverts, the procrastinators, the optimists, the pessimists, the detail- oriented, the impetuous, the loudmouths, the big shots, the egomaniacs, and a host of others.
- Successful salespersons are also excellent managers. They have to manage time, territory, personal habits, and life in general. The better they manage their lives, the better they will be able to manage their business
- Successful sales professionals learn to keep a balance. This area is where many people drop the ball because they think balance means giving equal priority and the same amount of time to everything.
- You must separate priorities and balance—“priorities” relate to chronological order; “balance” relates to variety.
- _The key is in understanding that when all is said and done, you must be able to answer the following question: `Are you happy, healthy, and
reasonably prosperous and secure, and do you have friends, peace of mind, and good family relationships?` As you examine each of these areas, let me challenge you to look at your activities and daily tasks. Do the results of the tasks you are working on yield the results you are looking for? If not, why not? If not, what are you going to do about it? These are the questions individuals who would have their names on the doors of the executive suites of tomorrow must answer._

## Book 2. Sell with a story by _`Paul Smith`_

_`But, as you can see in the picture, there’s not much more than cactus on the island for them to eat. And pigs don’t much like cactus. I guess in typical laid-back Bahamian fashion, the entrepreneur failed to plan that far ahead. So the pigs weren’t doing very well. But at some point, a restaurant owner on a nearby island started bringing his kitchen refuse by boat over to Big Major Cay and dumping it a few dozen yards off shore. The hungry pigs eventually learned to swim to get to the food. Each generation of pigs followed suit, and now all the pigs on the island can swim.`_

- Stories sell. And the people who can tell a good sales story sell more than
  people who can’t.
- Many people assume that a talent for storytelling is the kind of thing you’re either born with or you’ll never have. And while it’s true that some people are born with a natural ability to tell stories, it’s not true that you can’t learn it.

- What is a sales story, why should you tell them, which sales stories should you tell and when should you tell them, how can you come up with these stories, and how can you craft and deliver them for maximum impact.

## Features of story-telling

1. **Time**
2. **Place**
3. **A main Character**
4. **An obstacle**
5. **A Goal**
6. **Events**

## WHY TELL SALES STORIES?

1. STORIES HELP THE BUYER RELAX AND JUST LISTEN
2. STORIES HELP BUILD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS

- A story is the shortest distance between being a **`stranger`** and a **`friend`**.
- Sory-Telling is like extending your hand for a handshake

3. STORYTELLING SPEAKS TO THE PART OF THE BRAIN WHERE DECISIONS ARE ACTUALLY MADE

- So if you’re trying to influence buyers’ decisions, using facts and rational arguments alone isn’t enough. You need to influence them emotionally, and stories are your best vehicle to do that.
- The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor. - **_Psychologist Jonathan Haidt_**

4. STORIES MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE BUYER TO REMEMBER YOU, YOUR IDEAS, AND YOUR PRODUCT

- `Two legs` sit on `three legs`, eating `one leg`. Then along comes `four legs` and steals `one leg` from `two legs`. `Two legs` then hits `four legs` with `three legs` and gets his `one leg` back. `A young boy` **_(two legs)_** sits on a `stool` **_(three legs)_**, eating a `chicken bone` **_(one leg)_**. Then along comes a `dog` **_(four legs)_** that steals the `chicken bone` **_(one leg)_** from the `boy` **_(two legs)_**. The `boy` **_(two legs)_** then hits the `dog` **_(four legs)_** with the `stool` **_(three legs)_** and gets his `chicken bone` **_(one leg)_** back.

5. STORYTELLING ACTUALLY INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT YOU’RE SELLING

- _`They then asked volunteers to write short, fictional stories about each item. For example, to accompany a ceramic piggy bank, one author wrote a story from the perspective of a little girl who thought the piggy bank was cursed. Her father would come home each payday and put half his pay in the piggy bank, only to watch during the week as the paper money in the pig turned into coins and then eventually disappeared.
Walker and Glenn then placed each item for sale on eBay. But instead of putting a simple description next to the picture of each item, they put only the fictional story that had been written for it. Care was taken to make sure it was clear that the story was purely fictional so as not to suggest that the object being sold was somehow more special than the common household item it appeared to be.
Within five months, all 100 items had been sold. The experimenters originally paid a total of $128.74 for the items, but the resale price paid on eBay totaled $3,612.51, or a 2,800 percent increase in value. In the words of Walker and Glenn, their experiment showed that “Narrative transforms insignificant objects into significant ones.” In other words, stories turned cheap objects into valuable ones.`_

6. STORYTELLING HIGHLIGHTS YOUR MAIN IDEA BY
   MOVING IT TO ANOTHER CONTEXT - People want things to be right and when they’re not, they obsess with what’s
   “wrong”
7. STORIES ARE CONTAGIOUS
8. STORYTELLING GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE
   ORIGINAL
9. YOUR BUYERS WANT MORE STORIES FROM YOU
   1. Why and how your company was founded,
   2. who you are and what your values are,
   3. how and why the product you’re selling was invented,
   4. stories about how the product is made, and
   5. the level of integrity they can expect from you and your company.
10. STORYTELLING IS MORE FUN THAN DELIVERING A
    CANNED SALES PITCH, FOR YOU AND THE BUYER

### WHAT SALES STORIES YOU NEED AND WHEN TO TELL THEM

#### when to tell a story. The moment you introduce yourself is when you tell a story.

_`THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY you have to tell a story is the moment you introduce
yourself to a potential new customer. It could be in an email you’re sending or a
phone call you’re placing for the purpose of introducing yourself. Or it could be
face to face at a networking event as you’re exchanging business cards with
someone who may or may not turn out to be a prospect. Whatever the venue, the
question you’re answering is likely the same: “So, what do you do for a living?”THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY you have to tell a story is the moment you introduce
yourself to a potential new customer. It could be in an email you’re sending or a
phone call you’re placing for the purpose of introducing yourself. Or it could be
face to face at a networking event as you’re exchanging business cards with
someone who may or may not turn out to be a prospect. Whatever the venue, the
question you’re answering is likely the same: “So, what do you do for a living?”`_

### EXPLAINING WHAT YOU DO SIMPLY

**_`hors d’oeuvre table`_**
Introduction sample
_“I represent a
company that’s best in class at optimizing the distribution channels between the
core manufacturing center and the desired consumer experience.”_

- So basically what I do is to look at all the steps in the process and try
  to figure out if there is some way we can do them faster, better, less expensively, or more
  efficiently.
  1So basically what I do is to look at all the steps in the process and try
  to figure out if there is some way we can do them faster, better, less expensively, or more
  efficiently.
- Just rely on your knowledge
  of the business and the typical type of problems your company tends to solve,
  and create a plausible storyline around it

### EXPLAINING WHOM YOU’VE HELPED AND HOW

- Story-Telling It’s the shortest path from
  _`“Hello, nice to meet you”`_ to _`“When’s a good day for me to stop by your office?”`_

## Exercise

A. Invent a “What I do, simply” story

- Choose a fictional main character in a typical industry you
  serve.
- List a plausible series of events that leads to the problem your
  product or service is designed to fix
- Briefly describe what that problem looks like to the customer
- Write one sentence to describe what you or your company
  does to help fix that problem

B. Develop a “Whom I’ve helped and how” story.

- Choose an actual client in a typical industry you serve. (You
  don’t need to reveal the client’s name.)
- Sketch out a brief outline of the events that led up to the
  client’s needing your product or service—in other words, the
  background and the problem or opportunity the client
  encountered. (Include just the basic facts for now.
- List the main steps of what you or your product did for the
  client
- Explain the outcome in terms of how it benefited the customer
  (e.g., “And that’s when the procurement director really got a
  seat at the decision-making table”).

### STORIES FOR MOTIVATION

### FINDING YOUR PERSONAL MOTIVATION STORY

- _`“Sales isn’t something you do to someone. It’s something you do for someone.” In other words, if you do your job properly, you’re doing people a great service"` **zig Ziglar**_

### STORIES TO RELAX AND TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF THE CALL

- _Over the years I’ve learned to focus on all the positives and remind myself why I’m there in the first place. One of the most valuable techniques I have—it sounds a bit crazy at first, but it makes sense—is to tell myself that I am financially independent and I don’t need this deal. I’ve found that, by adopting this mindset, I relax more and care less. Instead of living with the burden of the whole company’s future, and that of its workforce, on my shoulders, I become a gentleman of means
  indulging in some sport_

## EXERCISE

1. Find your own motivational sales story. Think about a time you went above and beyond what was expected of you and made an extraordinary difference for your client. Turn that into a story you tell yourself before every call.
2. Think of a story that helps you relax and takes the stress out of selling. An example would be stories that help you think of yourself as the assistant buyer instead of the salesperson (as Zig Ziglar suggested). Lanigan and Goodbody’s story about a “gentleman of means” is another good example

### GETTING BUYERS TO TELL THEIR STORY

- _YOUR FIRST OBJECTIVE in a sales call should be to get buyers to tell you their stories, not the other way around. If you don’t hear their stories first, how will you know which of your stories to tell?_
- _“You wouldn’t trust a physician who walked into the examining room, spent an hour
  telling you how great he was, and then wrote a prescription, would you?” Of course not. Then why would a buyer accept the recommendation of a salesperson who did the same thing?_

### FIVE WAYS TO GET BUYERS TO OPEN UP AND TELL YOU STORIES

- **Shut Up and Listen**
- **Ask Questions That Require a Story for an Answer**
  - **If you ask yes or no questions, you’ll get yes or no answers. Just asking questions isn’t enough. You have to ask the right kind of questions. Here are some tips.**
  - **If you want to hear a story, don’t ask someone to tell you a story. Ask her to tell you about something that happened:**
  - If you’re selling high-speed Internet service, asking “Do you like your current Internet service?” won’t get you any stories. But if you ask “Have you ever noticed that your Internet slows down after dinner?” your prospect is likely to launch into a story about the last time that happened: “Oh yeah, it does! Last Monday night I had all the guys over for the football game. In the middle of the first quarter, it started to buffer every few seconds. It got so bad, we had to go to Jim’s house to finish the game. It was embarrassing for me, and Jim’s wife wasn’t too happy with us either . . .’
- **Ask About Something Personal in the Buyer’s Office**
- **Get Buyers Away from the Office**
- **Tell Your Stories First**
  - If all else fails, lead by example. If you want to get buyers to tell personal stories about where they grew up, you tell a personal story about where you grew up. If you want them to tell a story about a problem they’re having with their computer, you tell a story about a problem you’re having with your computer. You know this works because it works on you. When people tell you a story, the most likely thing that’s running through your head is “Hey, something like that happened to me once,” and now you can’t wait to tell them about it. Just remember, when the buyer interrupts and starts telling you his story, refer back to tactic #1 above. Shut up and listen.

## Execise

1. **Create a list of questions to elicit the following stories from your buyers. In your next meeting, ask them for:**
   1. Personal stories to help you get to know them better
   1. Stories about the biggest problems they’re facing, so you can get a concrete idea of how you might help them
   1. Stories about how their favorite suppliers became their favorite suppliers, so you can become the next one.
2. **Draft planning notes for your next meeting to get your buyer to open up and tell you stories instead of facts. These notes should include:**
   1. Shut up and listen. Leave some silent space in the conversation with room for the buyer to fill with a story.
   2. Require a story for an answer. 1. Ask open-ended questions instead of short-answer or yes/no
      questions. 2. Ask about specific events in time (What happened last year when . . . ?”). 1. Use “problem prompts” (“Have you ever noticed that your Internet slows down after dinner?”).
      Ask “day in the life” questions (“Tell me what a typical day is like for one of your team members today? A year from now?”).
3. Plan to get your buyer away from the office. Think of three specific opportunities to do that this year (for example, a market visit, a tour of retail stores or manufacturing plants, or attending a conference with you).
4. Create a list of your own stories that demonstrate the three stories you want to hear from the buyer. Your buyer will respond to hearing your story by telling a similar one of her own:
   1. Personal “get to know you” story
   2. “Biggest problem” story
   3. “Favorite supplier (or customer)” story

## BUILDING RAPPORT

- Building trust and rapport with a potential
  buyer is usually the earliest objective a salesperson has and storytelling is the quickest way to do that.

### There are five of these stories you can, and should, have in your repertoire of stories to tell.

**1. WHY I DO WHAT I DO” STORIES**

- People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you
  do it.
- What drew you to the profession or the company you work for?

**2. I’LL TELL YOU WHEN I CAN’T HELP YOU” STORIES**

- If you’re honest enough to tell buyers
  when your company is not well suited for a particular need they have, they’re
  more likely to believe you when you tell them you are the best solution.

**3. I’LL TELL YOU WHEN I MADE A MISTAKE” STORIES**

- The second way to immediately earn trust and credibility with your buyer is to
  admit you made a mistake before the buyer hears about it from someone else. If
  you admit your own mistakes, they’re more likely to find out sooner when they
  have a problem

**4. I’LL GO TO BAT FOR YOU WITH MY COMPANY”
STORIES**

**5. I’M NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM” STORIES**

- It helps get rid of negative
  preconceptions about you.

**6. STORIES ABOUT YOUR COMPANY**

- Once your buyers understand who you are and what you’re all about, they’ll
  want to know about the company you represent. Just like you, your company has
  a resume of facts. And just like you, your company should have stories for when
  you’re ready to get past the facts. 1. **Founding Stories:** `Backroads is the world’s #1 active travel company. We’ve been in business for 36 years since
our CEO, Tom Hale, founded the company in 1979. From our first trips in California, today we
operate in 48 countries around the world. Each year, our 500 leaders take more than 29,000 guests
on at least 2,000 exciting trips.
You could be hiking or biking or kayaking, but wherever you are, you won’t be bored. From our
expert trip designers and engaging leaders to our skilled bike mechanics and stellar guest service
team, quality is woven into the philosophy and fabric of our company. We call it guest focus, and
we aim to be the most guest-focused company out there.`
  **Second story** `When our founder, Tom Hale, was a kid, he wasn’t much of a fan of mass tourism. You know,
big theme parks where people are shuffled around in herds and stand in line for hours just for a
three-minute ride. He felt like he was trapped in an artificial, sedentary environment with a bunch of
strangers.
Then when he grew up, his first job out of college was in a big office building in Las Vegas. Six
months into it, he realized his job was a lot like those vacations he never liked as a kid: trapped in a
huge artificial city, working long hours in the same spot, surrounded by lots of people he didn’t
know.
Then one night he woke up at 2 a.m. with an idea. And by 8 o’clock the next morning, he’d
sketched out a plan for a more exciting career for himself, and a better vacation experience for
everyone else. And that’s when Backroads was born.
His idea was to thoughtfully plan out authentic, active, outdoor experiences, in naturally
beautiful locations, in small groups that you help select. That way, whether you’re hiking, biking,
kayaking, or something else, it’s never fake, you’ll never get bored, and you’ll always be among
friends.`

ii. **“How We’re Different from Our Competitors” Stories:**

## Execise

1. Brainstorm ideas for these five stories about you. 1. Why I do what I do 2. I’ll tell you when I can’t help you” story. Think of a time you
   were honest enough to tell a buyer you’re not their best
   solution. 3. “I’ll tell you when I made a mistake” story. Think of a time
   when you made a mistake and owned up to it with the buyer
   before they heard about it from anyone else 4. I’ll go to bat for you” story 5. I’m not who you think I am” story. What negative
   preconceptions are your prospects likely to have about you?
   Make a list of them, along with an idea for a story to
   demonstrate that you actually possess the opposite quality
2. Brainstorm ideas for these two stories about your company
   1. Your company’s founding story. If you don’t already know it,
      interview your company’s founder, CEO, oldest employee, or
      corporate historian and find out
   2. How we’re different from our competitors” story. Consider
      Sharad Madison’s story of walking the halls at Verizon to see
      how the cleaning was being done. What story could you tell to
      show how your product or service is unique?
3. Identify promising topics or common interests to build stories around.

   1. Check out your buyer’s LinkedIn profile for interest groups,
      education, previous employers, authored posts, companies
      followed, etc.
   2. Try the Refresh app to get a common interest profile on all
      your prospects.
   3. Make a note for your next visit to your buyers’ offices to look
      around for diplomas, pictures, and art, etc. Think of your own
      stories that relate to what you find.

4. Find out what your buyer’s greatest fears are. (Getting fired? Not
   getting promoted? A poor performance rating?) Create a lasting bond
   by telling your own story surrounding that same fear

## Book 3. The art of War by _`Sun Tzu`_

### Chapter 1.

i. **`Sun Tzu said:`** The art of war is of vital importance to the
State.

ii. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
neglected.

iii. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be
taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to
determine the conditions obtaining in the field.

    a. The Moral Law
    b. Heaven
    c. Earth
    d. The Commander
    e. Method and Discipline

    A. The `MORAL LAW` causes the people to be in complete accordwith their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of theirlives, undismayed by any danger.

    B. `HEAVEN` signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

    C. `EARTH` comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

    D. The `COMMANDER` stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.

    E. By METHOD AND DISCIPLINE are to be understood the  marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

### _`These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.`_

iv. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine
the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a
comparison, in this wise:

    1. Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
    2. Which of the two generals has most ability?
    3. With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?
    4. On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
    5. Which army is stronger?
    6. On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
    7. In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?

## Book 4. 365 Days With Self-Discipline by _`Martins Meadow`_

`I believe
that if a person wants to reach their full potential, he or she can’t avoid
discomfort by` _Martins Meadow_

`Self-discipline means living your life the hard way: resisting temptations
and instant gratification, in order to receive bigger and better rewards in the
future`

**Day 1**
`On Living the Hard Way Life’s easy when you live it the hard way... and hard if you try to live it the
easy way` _Dave Kekich_

**Day 2**
`On Your Choice s Your choices are made in a
moment, but their consequences will transcend a
lifetime.`
_MJ DeMarco_

- `Eat this greasy, high-calorie hamburger or prepare a healthy salad? Sleep in
and barely get to work on time or wake up at 5 a.m. to work on your side
business before going to work at your day job? Stop trying the moment you get
rejected or swallow your pride and keep going, despite hearing “no” dozens of
times? `

**Day 3**
`On Being a Human Willpower is what
separates us from the animals. It’s the capacity to
restrain our impulses, resist temptation — do what’s
right and good for us in the long run, not what we
want to do right now. It’s central, in fact, to
civilization.`
_Roy Baumeister_

- ` Unfortunately, many people live by the principle of “if it feels good, do
it, and if it doesn’t, don’t do it.”`

**Day 4**
` On Creating Systems I value self-discipline,
but creating systems that make it next to impossible to
misbehave is more reliable than self-control.`
_Tim Ferriss_

- `If you go to seedy bars every week, your chances of getting punched in the
face are higher than those of a person spending their evenings at home with a
book. Likewise, the best way to protect yourself against temptations is to avoid
them — and for that, plain old preparation is more valuable than self-control.`

**Day 5**
`On Enslavement to Self. Before complaining that you are a slave to another, be sure that you are not
a slave to self. Look within; you will find there, perchance, slavish thoughts,
slavish desires, and in your daily life and conduct slavish habits. Conquer these;
cease to be a slave to self, and no man will have the power to enslave you.`
_James Allen_

**Day 6**
`On Superhumans.
Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything
around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than
you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things
that other people can use.`
_Steve Jobs_

**Day 7**
`On Poverty and Self-Discipline
A second line of research has shown that economic stress robs us of
cognitive bandwidth. Worrying about bills, food or other problems, leaves less
capacity to think ahead or to exert self-discipline. So, poverty imposes a mental
tax.`
_Nicholas Kristof_

- `If you’re struggling with finances, make it one of your priorities to get out
of debt as quickly as you can and build an emergency fund covering at least
three to six months of basic living expenses. In addition to improving your
financial health, it will dramatically reduce stress and strengthen your ability to
delay gratification and make more optimal choices favoring your future.`

# Week 2

**Day 8**
`On Unessential Necessities Epicurus wanted to
examine the things he thought he needed so he could
determine which of them he could in fact live without.
He realized that in many cases, we work hard to
obtain something because we are convinced that we
would be miserable without it. The problem is that we
can live perfectly well without some of these things,
but we won’t know which they are if we don’t try
living without them.`
_William B. Irvine_

**Day 9**
`In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings
of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive
decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with virtual future selves
exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over
immediate ones.`
_Hal E. Hershfield_

- `The person you’ll become in ten years will most likely not be the same
person you are today, but it will still be you — and it’s in your hands whether,
ten years from now you’ll look back and feel glad you extended self-empathy
well into the future, or find that you decided to be selfish and steal from your
future for some fleeting pleasure today`.

**Day 10**
`Words create sentences; sentences create paragraphs; sometimes
paragraphs quicken and begin to breathe.
_Stephen King_`

- `Building self-discipline is similar to writing a novel. You might consider a
disciplined person who always wakes up at four in the morning, is physically
active every day, eats a healthy diet, is super productive, and is capable of
balancing it all with their social life and family obligations as a superhuman. But
in reality, this person, like the bestselling novelist, probably started with one
simple change and kept building on top of it`

- `Whenever you get discouraged, or feel tired by how far you still have to go
to accomplish your goals, remind yourself that everybody who has built selfdiscipline had to go through the same process — starting with little changes
which then turned into habits, which then led to big lifestyle changes and
identity shifts, and eventually, into successes`

**Day 11**
`On Self-Discipline and Talent
Self-discipline without talent can often achieve astounding results, whereas
talent without self-discipline inevitably dooms itself to failure.`
_Sydney J. Harris_

- `Next time, before you complain that you don’t have a talent for something
or weren’t “born this way,” remind yourself that self-discipline, in many
situations, can more than make up for a lack of inborn traits.`

**Day 12**
`On Calmness of Mind Calmness of mind is
one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of
long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is
an indication of ripened experience, and of a more
than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations
of thought.`
_James Allen_

- `Such self-control feels like a superpower in today’s busy and fast-moving
world, in which distractions lurk at every corner and buzz in every pocket. A
person who’s capable of maintaining calmness of mind is a rare individual —
but fortunately you can also become one, if you’re only willing to put in some
effort.`
- `The more often you put yourself in a meditative state, the calmer you’ll
become in everyday situations. Cultivating calmness will lead to even more selfcontrol, and that will lead to an ever-heightening ability to control your state of
mind and prevent emotions from clouding your judgment.`

**Day 13**
`On What You Want Now and What You
Want Most Discipline is choosing between what you
want now and what you want most`

- `To achieve your long-term goals, make sure that the satisfaction you get
from what you want most is always much stronger than the satisfaction you can
get from what you want now.`

**Day 14**
`On Long-Term Focus
In order to succeed, you must have a long-term focus. Most of the
challenges in our lives come from a short-term focus.`
_Tony Robbins_

- `Analyze your goals and how you approach them. Replace short-termoriented behaviors with those that show that you’re in it for the long haul. Selfdiscipline isn’t limited to rejecting a cake or sticking to an exercise habit; you

## Book 5. No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline by _`Brian Tracy`_

- `“There are a thousand excuses for failure but never a good reason.”
—MARK TWAIN`
- `I discovered that you can achieve almost any goal you set for yourself if you have the discipline to
pay the price, to do what you need to do, and to never give up. —BRIAN TRACY`

- `Perhaps the most important insight of all with regard to success is that to achieve greatly, you must
become a different person. It is not the material things you accomplish or acquire that matter so much
as it is the quality of the person you must become to accomplish well above the average —BRIAN TRACY`

- `The
development of self-discipline is the high road that makes everything possible for you. —BRIAN TRACY`

- `‘Self-discipline is the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it,
whether you feel like it or not.’” —ELBERT HUBBARD`
- `“There are 999 other success principles that I have found in my reading and
experience, but without self-discipline, none of them work. With self-discipline, they all work.”`
- `Perhaps the two biggest enemies of success, happiness and personal fulfillment, are first the Path of
Least Resistance and, second, the Expediency Factor`

1. The Path of Least Resistance is what causes people to take the easy way in almost every situation.
   They seek shortcuts to everything. `They arrive at work at the last minute and leave at the first
opportunity. They look for get-rich-quick schemes and easy money. Over time, they develop the habit
of always seeking an easier, faster way to get the things they want rather than doing what is hard but
necessary to achieve real success.`
2. The Expediency Factor, which is an extension of the law of least resistance, is even worse when
   leading people to failure and underachievement. This principle says, `“People invariably seek the
fastest and easiest way to get the things they want, right now, with little or no concern for the longterm consequences of their behaviors.”` In other words, most people do what is expedient, what is fun
   and easy rather than what is necessary for success
