- As salespeople, we encounter people at every emotional level—when they’re happy, excited, and enthusiastic; and when they’re irritated and down in the dumps. We learn how to deal with the extroverts, the introverts, the procrastinators, the optimists, the pessimists, the detail- oriented, the impetuous, the loudmouths, the big shots, the egomaniacs, and a host of others.
- Successful salespersons are also excellent managers. They have to manage time, territory, personal habits, and life in general. The better they manage their lives, the better they will be able to manage their business

- *The key is in understanding that when all is said and done, you must be able to answer the following question: `Are you happy, healthy, and
reasonably prosperous and secure, and do you have friends, peace of mind, and good family relationships?` As you examine each of these areas, let me challenge you to look at your activities and daily tasks. Do the results of the tasks you are working on yield the results you are looking for? If not, why not? If not, what are you going to do about it? These are the questions individuals who would have their names on the doors of the executive suites of tomorrow must answer.*
